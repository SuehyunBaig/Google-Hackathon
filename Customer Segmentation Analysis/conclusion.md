# Customer Segmentation Analysis Conclusion
## Executive Summary
The single most significant cause of churn is the customer quality, as with the claim of the Product Leadership.

## Evidence
**1. Company Size**\
Churn rate is notably high (26.5%) with small-sized companies that consist of 1 to 10 employees. Churn rates of all other company sizes (around 4%) are
nowhere close to this figure. While we may need further evidence showing that these companies have actually gone out of business to be more
rigorous, this finding is still largely aligned with the Product Leadership's claim,
as it has to do with the traits of customers acquired by the Sales Team.

**2. Product Tier**\
Churn rate analysis by product tier suggests that "Starter" product - the most basic type of offerings which is generally adopted by
individuals or businesses just starting - experience the highest churn rate. This once again supports the claim that customer quality
may be the primary cause of Q3 crisis, as start-ups have relatively weak foothold in market and often end up discontinuing
their businesses after a short period of time.

## Recommendation
**Reassess the customer portfolio (strike a balance between quality and quantity)**\
Sales Leadership may want to consider adjusting the customer portfolio by increasing the portion of mid-sized
companies and enterprises. This may somewhat limit new customer acquisition opportunities as the number of companies generally
decreases as company size grows, but it will help BizGrow to maintain a more stable customer base with manageable churn rates.
